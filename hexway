How to install Hexway?
Preparation
Before installation, prepare a virtual machine or server with one of the supported operating systems:

CentOS 8
RHEL 8
Ubuntu 18.04
Ubuntu 20.04
Install Docker engine and Docker compose to the server or virtual machine.

Installing Hive
Download the installation file;
Copy the installation file install_hw_bw_en-US_<version>.run to the server using any SSH file transfer client;
   scp install_hw_bw_en-US_<version>.run /server/path
Execute the following command to grant all the necessary permissions to the installation file (optional):
   chmod +x ./install_hw_bw_en-US_<version>.run
To start installation, run the command:
   bash ./install_hw_bw_en-US_<version>.run
Once installed, the platform will start automatically, and you will see the following message:

Connection settings
Note: the following settings are required only if you need to create connection between Hive and Apiary projects.

To connect Hive and Apiary projects, add the following settings to the Apiary platform:

Edit file /opt/hw-fh/config/user.ini (root privileges required);
Add the following lines to the [main] section:
   [main]
   ; rabbitmq port:
   rmq.client.port = 5672
   ; DNS name or IP address of the machine you install Apiary to:
   rmq.client.host = <my-apiary.example.com>
To apply settings, run the following command (root privileges required):
   /opt/hw-fh/bin/reconfig
Open Platform in the browser by the address https://<your-server-ip-or-dns>/;
Now you can connect Hive and Apiary projects (see sections: Hive project settings and Apiary project settings).
You can find more information about installing and updating the platform in Apiary Installation guide.
